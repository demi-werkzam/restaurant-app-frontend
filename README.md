## `Intro` 
Hi I am Demi. A foodie living in Amsterdam. As a food lover going out to restaurants to eat is one of my favorite things. 
This is a the first version of the app, more features will be added. You can find them here. 

## `The Search Restaurant App`
As a lover of food and restaurants I chose to dedicate my portfolio project to other people in Amsterdam who love the same things.  
Users can look for nice restauants in Amserdam can use the app to search for restaurants, keep a list of restaurants that they have been to, review the restaurants by liking them and inviting other users to out to a restaurant.

## `Goals`
- Practise fullstack development;
- Apply what I have learned in Codaisseur's bootcamp;
- Practise learning new technologies on my own;
- Showcase development approach of using wireframes and user stories;
- practise proper git usage, commits and branching.

## `Demo` 

#### `User stories and wireframe` 

- As a person looking for a restaurant to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner in Amsterdam:


  - I want to be able to see the restaurants on a map, so I can chose which restaurant I want to go to;


  - I want to be able to click on the restaurant and see the contact info of the restaurant and the location.


- As a user of the restaurant searching app:
  

  - I want to be able to login;
  
  - I want to show that I went to a restaurant ‚úÖ ;
  
  - I want to like a restaurant I have visited üíñ ;
  
  - I want to be able to see a list of the restaurants that I've liked and the restaurants that I have been to;
  
  - I want to be able to add a new restaurant;
  
  - I want to be able to see a list of restaurants that I have added.

  ## `Server Repository`
 
The repository for the backend can be found here. This is a RESTful API using Express.js. The database is built using Postgres. Here is the data model. Object-relational mapping is done using Sequelize.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
